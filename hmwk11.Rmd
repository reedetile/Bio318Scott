*Repeat the exercise from the Batch Processing Lecture (5 April), but do it using real data sets rather than purely simulated. Check with folks in your lab to see if there are multiple data sets available for analysis, or ask Nick, Lauren, or Emily for suggestions for other data sources. Stick to simple data analyses and graphics, but try to set it up as a batch process that will work on multiple files and save summary results to a common file.* 

For this exercise, I used a few data sets from my master's thesis work. I built a simple for loop to read in all of the files at once. Realizing that was pretty simple, I then went ahead and made another for loop so I could create a list of the column names for each dataset.

file_names <- list.files(path=path.data)
head(file_names)

#for loop to read in CSV files)
setwd(path.data)
list <- list()
for(i in 1:length(file_names)){
  file.name <- file_names[i]
  list[[i]] <- read.csv(file = file.name)
}
names(list) <- c('Exp3','Exp1','Exp2')
list2env(list,.GlobalEnv)

#Create function to read names
names.list <- list()
for(i in 1:length(file_names)){
  names.list[[i]] <- names(list[[i]])
}
names.list[2]
